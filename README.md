# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This Project is all about  Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

 * I downloaded the dataset from a zip file and set it to my working director
 * I extracted  the activity and feature inf
 * I extracted both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect    a mean or standard deviation
 * I  also extracted  the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges the columns    with the dataset as requested for the project work



This are my concepts and list on how to go about this project work.

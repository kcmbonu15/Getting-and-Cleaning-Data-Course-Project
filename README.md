# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This Project is all about  Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

 * I downloaded the dataset from a zip file and set it to my working directory
 * I load the data in my R environment
 * I load the data from the targeted files, Subjects files and features files
 * I look at the structure of the files i loaded to see how the variables look like
 * I merge the training and the test data to create one all datasets i used rbind()
 * I rename the variables to subject and activity and also merge the columns to get an ideal 
     dataframe
 * I subset the data frame by the selected names features and check the structure.
 * I used the descriptive activity names to name the activities
 * I finally write the results into a text files called tidydata
 



This are my concepts and list on how to go about this project work and the output will be a tidy text file
